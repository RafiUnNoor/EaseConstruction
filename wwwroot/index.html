        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Hold down left mouse button to rotate the model. Hold down right mouse button to move the model. Use the toolbar which is under 
            the model preview panel.Use middle mouse button / Scrolling button to zoom in or zoom out.
            <ul>
                <li><p>You can also use the first toolber to orbit , zoom and pan for better understanding of the model.</p></li>
                <li><p>Second part of toolbar is for measurement , section analysis , document browser and explode. These will help you 
                    to understand the design and elements better.</p></li>
                <li><p>Third part of the toolber is model tree , properties , viewer settings and a full screen option. you can browse through
                    model tree and document browser for other documents of the revit file. </p></li>
                <li><p>Last part will help you to summarise the model or any part of it. Other button is for Data grid which basically lists 
                    all the parts of the model.</p></li>

            <h3>About this app</h3>
            <p>In recent years, the web has gained power of 3D displaying and manipulation. With the emerging of new technology such as HTML5 
                and WebGL, the web has transformed from a content sharing platform to a web application platform.In the BEC (Building 
                Engineering Construction) industry, BIM (Building Information Model) has become a prevalent industry standard. It is widely 
                adopted in the life circle of a building, from conceptual design to post-occupancy management. Currently, the BIM platform is 
                implemented through sophisticated desktop-based application, which has limited access to the general public and stake-holders
                of a building. There will be great potentials in the development of web application based on BIM platform. This project 
                introduces a framework of web application utilizing BIM.
            </p>
           <p>The initial function of the web application is 3D building visualization. With WebGL, 3D building models 
            can be uploaded to the web space. Users can interact with the model 
            like in desktop-based modeling tools such as Rhino, Sketchup. The public, stake-holders and design professionals
             will have access to the 3D building models as long as they have internet connection.</p>
